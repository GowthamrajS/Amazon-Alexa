   About the Data

    This dataset consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and
    feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc. for learning how to train Machine for sentiment analysis.

   Source
   
   Extracted from Amazon's website

        You can use this data to analyze Amazonâ€™s Alexa product ; discover insights into consumer reviews and
        assist with machine learning models.
        
        You can also train your machine models for sentiment analysis and
        analyze customer reviews how many positive reviews ?
        and how many negative reviews ?
